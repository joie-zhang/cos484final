# COS 484 Final Project

The final project offers you the chance to apply your newly acquired skills towards an in-depth NLP application. Students are required to complete the final project in teams of 3 students.

There are two options for the final project:

- Reproducing an ACL/NAACL/EMNLP 2021-2023 paper (encouraged);

- Complete a research project (for this option, you need to discuss your proposal and get prior approval from the instructor).

All the final projects will be completed in teams of 3 students. Find your teammates early!

## Deliverables

The final project is worth 35% of your course grade. The deliverables include:

- **Proposal** (0%): You need to turn in a one-page proposal on April 5th. The proposal should outline what you propose to do and a rough plan for how you will pursue the project. We will then provide feedback and guidance on the direction to maximize the projectâ€™s chance of succeeding. This proposal is not graded.

- **Project presentation** (10%): At the end of the semester, we will schedule project presentations for all the projects in the class.

- **Final paper** (25%): You need to complete a final report in the style of a conference submission. we recommend you to use the [ACL 2023 template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2023-proceedings-template/qjdgcrdwcnwp). It should begin with an abstract and introduction, clearly describe the proposed idea or exploration, present technical details, give results, compare to baselines, provide analysis and discussion of the results, and cite any sources you used.

## Policy and Honor Code

- The final projects are required to be implemented in Python. You can use any deep learning framework such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

- You are free to discuss ideas and implementation details with other teams. However, under no circumstances may you look at another team's code, or incorporate their code into your project.

- Do not share your code publicly (e.g. in a public GitHub repo) until after the class has finished.
